- Working on showing all available entities in the Assembly in the left panel
- I need to figure out what to do with `NodeId` vs `UniqueID`
- I noticed something weird on saved assemblies. It seems data on assembly files are appended and/or duplicated somehow. Files get bigger and bigger. And take a lot of time to load/save.
- I'm now listing the available entities in the Assembly in the left panel. It allows selection (and multiple selection with CTRL).
- I started working on showing the current entity context menu (i.e. when right-clicking it). I want to be able to delete entities or re-parent them. 

# TODO
- [ ] Fix assembly file size increasing bug.
- [x] Show available nodes in graph's left panel
- [x] Prefer using `UniqueID` instead of `ax::NodeEditor::NodeId`
- [x] Show selected nodes in graph's left panel
- [ ] Show selected node's context menu
- [ ] Show link's context menu
- [ ] Show pin's context menu (?)
- [ ] Allow detaching nodes
- [ ] Allow re-parenting nodes
- [ ] Move `Assembly` to `Crimild::Core`
- [ ] Add a transformation node to the Assembly graph
- [ ] Simplify `View` hierarchy. Just have a `draw()` virtual functional. Windows, Modals and other subclasses may include a `drawContent` as needed.
- [ ] Render File System in a splitter panel
- [ ] Handle object selection in Scene3D (maybe storing in the Assembly's Editable extension?)
