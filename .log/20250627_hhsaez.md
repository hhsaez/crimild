- Adding lights to the scene. It was surprisingly easy to do :)
- Working on showing all available entities in the Assembly in the left panel
- I realized I'm mixing UniqueId with NodeId. I need to use the former one only.
- I also realized that I need to move `Assembly` to `Crimild::Core` (or to its own package). Right now it's part of the Editor, which prevents it from being loaded correctly when I implement players.

# TODO
- [x] Add lights to the Assembly graph
- [ ] Show available nodes in graph's left panel
- [ ] Prefer using `UniqueID` instead of `ax::NodeEditor::NodeId`
- [ ] Show selected nodes in graph's left panel
- [ ] Show selected node's context menu
- [ ] Show link's context menu
- [ ] Show pin's context menu (?)
- [ ] Allow detaching nodes
- [ ] Allow re-parenting nodes
- [ ] Move `Assembly` to `Crimild::Core`
- [ ] Add a transformation node to the Assembly graph
- [ ] Simplify `View` hierarchy. Just have a `draw()` virtual functional. Windows, Modals and other subclasses may include a `drawContent` as needed.
- [ ] Render File System in a splitter panel
- [ ] Handle object selection in Scene3D (maybe storing in the Assembly's Editable extension?)
