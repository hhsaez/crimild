- Adding lights to the scene. It was surprisingly easy to do :)

# TODO
- [x] Add lights to the Assembly graph
- [ ] Allow detaching nodes
- [ ] Add a transformation node to the Assembly graph
- [ ] Simplify `View` hierarchy. Just have a `draw()` virtual functional. Windows, Modals and other subclasses may include a `drawContent` as needed.
- [ ] Render File System in a splitter panel
- [ ] Handle object selection in Scene3D (maybe storing in the Assembly's Editable extension?)
