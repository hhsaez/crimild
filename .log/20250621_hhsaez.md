* Now that persistence is finaly done (for now) for assemblies, I'm moving forward with the editor. 
* I'm trying to get rid of the dockspace, since I don't really need to re-arrange panels when editing and assembly. But I do need resizing, so I'm considering using a splitter. I noticed one is used in the demo project for the graph editor, so I'm starting there.
* Spent some time trying to create a reusable Splitter component without luck. I don't have a good understanding of ImGui's rendering process yet. Still, I managed to make a splitter work by reusing code from the graph demo. It's not ideal nor reusable in other components, but it works, even nested.
* Next step is to render some actual panels in each of the splitter sections.
