- I decided to start logging here so later I can use LLMs to have more context on what I do I do need to be extra careful when merging conflicts, but it should be fine since I'm using one file per date (famous last words).
- Maybe I can use it for the blog too... Maybe
- Also, I might move this logs to their own repo, so they don't polute the main one. Maybe.
- Worked on centralizing loading and saving assets (i.e. assemblies) from `Project` class. I think this is going to be changed in the future to a more robust solution, like using an EntityManager plus FileSystem utlities.
- I'm thinking on moving FileSystem to its own package. Or at least to Foundation
