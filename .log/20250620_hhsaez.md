- I decided to start logging here so later I can use LLMs to have more context on what I do I do need to be extra careful when merging conflicts, but it should be fine since I'm using one file per date (famous last words).
- Maybe I can use it for the blog too... Maybe
- Also, I might move this logs to their own repo, so they don't polute the main one. Maybe.
- Worked on centralizing loading and saving assets (i.e. assemblies) from `Project` class. I think this is going to be changed in the future to a more robust solution, like using an EntityManager plus FileSystem utlities.
- I'm thinking on moving FileSystem to its own package. Or at least to Foundation
- I realized that a Project is load after the `LayoutManager` has been initialized. So, I changed the way layouts are loaded in order for them to use the project's root directory to save the layout file, provided there is an active proejct. Otherwise, the layout is empty.
- Load/Saving assemblies works!!
- TODO: I'm not sure where the graph config file is saved. I set it to use the root path of the current project, but I'm not seeing any file there. Maybe it's not used?
