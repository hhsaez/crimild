- I was trying to understad why I was not seeing renderables in the Scene3D panel
- Switching the the "albedo" view, did show the cube!!
- Since there are no lights, I can't see anything in the normal view.

# TODO
- [ ] Add lights to the Assembly graph
- [ ] Add a transformation node to the Assembly graph
- [x] Make the framegraph process to handle scenes from an Assambly
- [x] Render the assembly in the Scene3D panel
- [ ] Simplify `View` hierarchy. Just have a `draw()` virtual functional. Windows, Modals and other subclasses may include a `drawContent` as needed.
- [ ] Render File System in a splitter panel
- [ ] Handle object selection in Scene3D (maybe storing in the Assembly's Editable extension?)
