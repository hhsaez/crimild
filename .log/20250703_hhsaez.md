- Thinking about handling nodes, links and pins. I don't like having to represent them separately from the actual nodes in the assembly.
- Plot twist: turns out I'm already using unique IDs for links and pins (but not for nodes). Maybe I need to store them in the GraphEditorContext instead?
- Move link management to graph's context. I like it better.
- I need to move link rendering to context too and the "renderer" will only deal with link creation/update/removal. Then, I can do the same for pins.

# TODO
- [ ] Use unique IDs for nodes, links and pins. See comments [here](./20250701_hhsaez.md)
- [ ] Fix assembly file size increasing bug.
- [ ] Show link's context menu
- [ ] Show pin's context menu (?)
- [ ] Allow detaching nodes
- [ ] Allow re-parenting nodes
- [ ] Move `Assembly` to `Crimild::Core`
- [ ] Add a transformation node to the Assembly graph
- [ ] Simplify `View` hierarchy. Just have a `draw()` virtual functional. Windows, Modals and other subclasses may include a `drawContent` as needed.
- [ ] Render File System in a splitter panel
- [ ] Handle object selection in Scene3D (maybe storing in the Assembly's Editable extension?)
