* Contiuing work from yesterday. 
* I realized the graph editor is always rendered as a dockable window (because it's a Window instead of just a View). I'm considering refactoring this next so it's more reusable.
* I have a working prototype for the Assembly workspace using splitters instead of dockspace. It looks ugly, but it works!
* I made so the 3D Scene is rendered in the Assembly workspace, but I still need to figure out how to render the same scene we're editing.
* For object selection, I'm considering keeping some context in the assembly itself, maybe as an extension that may or may not get saved along with the assembly.

# TODO
- [ ] Simplify `View` hierarchy. Just have a `draw()` virtual functional. Windows, Modals and other subclasses may include a `drawContent` as needed.
- [x] Fix splitter max size
- [x] Render Scene3D in a splitter panel
- [ ] Render File System in a splitter panel
