- I started working on showing the current entity context menu (i.e. when right-clicking it). I want to be able to delete entities or re-parent them. 
- The issue with assembly files getting bigger and bigger keeps happening and it's becoming annoying. It takes a really long time to reload an assembly after a while. I'm deleting the file and recreate the assembly when it happens, but I'm going to need to find the cause sooner rather than later.

# TODO
- [ ] Fix assembly file size increasing bug.
- [x] Show selected node's context menu
- [ ] Show link's context menu
- [ ] Show pin's context menu (?)
- [x] Allow deleting nodes
- [ ] Allow detaching nodes
- [ ] Allow re-parenting nodes
- [ ] Move `Assembly` to `Crimild::Core`
- [ ] Add a transformation node to the Assembly graph
- [ ] Simplify `View` hierarchy. Just have a `draw()` virtual functional. Windows, Modals and other subclasses may include a `drawContent` as needed.
- [ ] Render File System in a splitter panel
- [ ] Handle object selection in Scene3D (maybe storing in the Assembly's Editable extension?)
