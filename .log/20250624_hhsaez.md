- Working on figuring out how to render the assembly in the Scene3D panel
- I also need to figure out how to handle object selection. I'm thinking on saving the selected object in an Editable extension in the Assembly itself. That way it will be saved as part of the Assembly. 
- I made it so it renders the scene in the assembly, but nothing is shown in the Scene3D panel. What am I missing?

# TODO
- [ ] Make the framegraph process to handle scenes from an Assambly
- [ ] Render the assembly in the Scene3D panel
- [ ] Simplify `View` hierarchy. Just have a `draw()` virtual functional. Windows, Modals and other subclasses may include a `drawContent` as needed.
- [ ] Render File System in a splitter panel
- [ ] Handle object selection in Scene3D (maybe storing in the Assembly's Editable extension?)
