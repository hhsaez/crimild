- Continue working on adding more tests to memory encoder. Copilot is a lot better now for replicating unit tests given the one for strings I created yesterday. Still not good to come up with more complex cases, though.
- Continue working on the text encoder.

# TODO
- [x] Unit tests for memory encoder
- [ ] Text encoding
- [ ] Unit tests for memory decoder
- [ ] Text decoding
- [ ] Fix assembly file size increasing bug.
- [ ] Use unique IDs for nodes, links and pins. See comments [here](./20250701_hhsaez.md)
- [ ] Show pin's context menu (do I need this?)
- [ ] Move `Assembly` to `Crimild::Core`
- [ ] Add a transformation node to the Assembly graph
- [ ] Simplify `View` hierarchy. Just have a `draw()` virtual functional. Windows, Modals and other subclasses may include a `drawContent` as needed.
- [ ] Render File System in a splitter panel
- [ ] Handle object selection in Scene3D (maybe storing in the Assembly's Editable extension?)
