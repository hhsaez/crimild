# Crimild's Mathematics Module

## `real` and high-precision computations.

## Constants

## Coordinate System
Crimild uses a right handed coordinate system. 

### The `FORWARD` vector
The FORWARD vector, declared as a `Vector3` constant, points towards the negative z-coordinate. 

## Low-level entities

### Tuple, Vector, Point and Normal abstractions

## Medium-level entities

### Ray

## High-level entities

### Transformation

## Testing
Most of the tests make use of the default `real_t` precision, so they will still be valid if we start using a different precision in the future.
