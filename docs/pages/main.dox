/**
	\mainpage Welcome to the Crimild Engine project
	
	Crimild is a multi-purpose, modern 3D graphics engine and game development kit
	that can be used to create a variety of graphic intensive applications,
	including games, simulations, training and architectural software.
	Written in portable C++ and using several multiplatform libraries and tools like
	OpenGL, SDL, libXML and CMake, it has been designed to make development of new
	3D applications easy.
